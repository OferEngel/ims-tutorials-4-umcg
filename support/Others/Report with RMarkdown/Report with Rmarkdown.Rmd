## Create R Markdown reports

### 

In this tutorial you will learn how to transform an R Markdown file into a polished report. 

R Markdown files tell a complete story of your analysis with text, code, and metadata -- and they do so in a reproducible way. We cover the essentials here.

Specifically, you will learn to:

1.  Knit your R Markdown file
2.  Use markdown for text formatting
3.  Customize the code and results visible to your report's audience
4.  Format the output style of your report

### Getting started

Before continuing, I recommend that you:

1. Navigate to the Files pane in the lower right hand corner of the IDE. **Click on the blue R Project icon** in the toolbar of the Files pane. This will ensure we are both starting from the same folder as you follow along with me.

    ![](images/rproj.png){.shadow width="100px" style="margin: 0 auto;"}
    
:::tip
R Markdown is a package that you don't need to explicitly install or load. The RStudio IDE does this automatically when needed, so we can begin using it right away.
:::

We're ready to begin!

## Knit your report

### Open a new R Markdown document

Let's open a fresh R Markdown document. **Follow along with me to create a new untitled R Markdown document**:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", out.extra = "class='shadow'" }
knitr::include_graphics("images/open.gif")
```

::: tip
Remember you can expand the width of this tutorial by dragging the sidebar divider to the right if the images appear too small.
:::

### `r emo::ji("yarn")` Knit to HTML

Click the Knit icon in the toolbar. It is circled below. (Save your file if prompted. I'm saving mine as "`my-file.Rmd`".)

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/knit.jpg")
```

Give it a try! What happens?

```{r knit-what-happens, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What happens after clicking Knit?",
  answer("A new file is created. It is a polished-looking version of your R Markdown file's contents.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Your R Markdown file was published on the internet.", correct = FALSE), 
  correct = "This new file opens up automatically in a new window. Go ahead and close it now.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  try_again = "Not quite. A new file is created, but it is only available to you.",
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### What happened?

After knitting, a new file is created. **Check your Files pane** in the RStudio IDE, which appears in the bottom right of your screen. Can you identify the new file?

```{r label, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("Look at your Files pane. Which do you think is the new file you created after clicking Knit?",
  answer("The file that has the extension '.html'", correct = TRUE),
  answer("There is no new file in my Files pane.", correct = FALSE, message = "There is! Knit your document again, and check which of your Files has the most recent 'Modified' timestamp."), 
  answer("A copy of the .Rmd file was created.", correct = FALSE, message = "Knitting does not create a new R Markdown file. Knitting uses an R Markdown file as the *source* for making a fancy new file of a different file format."),
  correct = "You created a new file called an HTML file. This new file contains the text, code, and code output from your R Markdown document. You can view it by opening up this file in a web browser-- its contents look grand!",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  try_again = "Knitting generates a new file from the contents of your R Markdown document. Try to identify it again.", 
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### Knitting to HTML

The process of creating this polished-looking report is called 'knitting'. And you have just knitted your R Markdown document to the HTML output format. Every time you click knit, this new HTML file is remade from scratch using the contents of your R Markdown document.

You can view the polished-report by opening up the HTML file in a web browser, but R typically opens it up automatically in a new window immediately after you knit.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", out.extra = "class='shadow'" }
knitr::include_graphics("images/files-pane.png")
```

### 

:::fyi
The HTML file is the default output format, but other output formats are possible too:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", out.extra = "class='shadow'"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/other-outputs.gif")
```

*Note:* For PDF output, you may need to install the tinytex package and then run `tinytex::install_tinytex()` before knitting.
:::

## Report reproducibly

### 

Whenever you knit, R Markdown runs all of your code from the top to the bottom of your document using a clean slate (i.e. a new R session) to make the polished report.

```{r reproducible, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What are the benefits of generating a polished report from a 'clean slate'?",
  answer("You are forced to document all the essential steps of your analysis in the R Markdown document.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("It encourages you to rely on code you've run in your console.", correct = FALSE, message = "R Markdown knitting actually *prevents* you from doing this -- and that's good! Referencing an object that exists only in your local R session (and not in the R Markdown code) will hinder efforts to reproduce your report in the future."), 
  answer("R produces an error if any code references any packages or objects that were not loaded or created in the R Markdown document.", correct = TRUE),
  correct = "These are key to making R Markdown an important tool for reproducible analysis and reporting.",
  try_again = "There are two correct answers. See if you can identify them.", 
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### 

By design, this process forces you -- the author of the report -- to document every part of your analysis, making it easy for your colleagues (or your future self!) to reproduce and confirm your results.

For example, if any part of your code references something that is not documented in the R Markdown file, you will get an error message when you try to knit!

::: tip
While you analyze your data, you should knit your report early and often to ensure that you are not forgetting to document key parts of your code.
:::

### 

Imagine you receive a draft of report from your colleague. In it, he explores data from the palmerpenguins package using a dplyr function.

Click the button below to download the report.

Let's check out this file. **Locate the file in your RStudio IDE and knit the document.**

### 

Hmm...when you try to knit his report you get an error:

```{r, error=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
filter(penguins, !is.na(body_mass_g))
```

**Inspect the document. What might be wrong? Can you fix it?**

```{r no-library, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("Identify the error. Then if possible, fix it and knit again.",
  answer("He has not loaded the right data set.", correct = FALSE),
  answer("You are using a different version of the R Markdown package than your colleague.", correct = FALSE),
  answer("He has a typo in his `filter()` statement.", correct = FALSE), 
  answer("He uses a function from a package that has not been loaded in the R Markdown document.", correct = TRUE, message = "`filter()` comes from the dplyr package, but this package has not been loaded in the R Markdown document. Load the missing package in the `setup` chunk near the top of the document."),
  correct = "Whoops, looks like your colleague's report is not reproducible as is. The error message is a bit misleading, but this is a common error to see when knitting. If there's not an obvious typo, ask yourself if all packages have been loaded in the `.Rmd` file.",
  try_again = "Give it another shot. What might your colleague have forgotten to include?",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### 

We'll continue to work with your colleague's report throughout this tutorial.

Now that you know how knitting helps keep your workflow reproducible, let's discuss how you can format and customize R markdown reports.

## Write with markdown

### 

The "markdown" in R Markdown refers to a set of symbols, like `#` and `*`, that you can use to format plain text in your file. When you knit, markdown generates the formatted text as headers, bolded text, etc., in the rendered report.

**Consider the two documents you have knit so far. What does the markdown symbol `#` do to plain text?**

```{r md-header, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("The markdown symbol `#` will...",
  answer("Italicize the text", correct = FALSE),
  answer("Format the text as a header", correct = TRUE), 
  answer("Allow you to insert a link to a website", correct = FALSE),
  incorrect = "Knit one of your documents and pay attention to the text with a `#` in front of it.",
  correct = "Yes, `#` is used to create headers. The more `#` you add, the lower in the hierarchy the header will be.",
  allow_retry = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### `r emo::ji("hash")` Headers

You can turn plain text into a header by starting the line with hashtag symbols `#` and a space.

When you write

```{code}
# Level 1 Header

## Level 2 Header

### Level 3 Header
```

R Markdown will turn it into:

![](images/header1.png){.shadow width="300px" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"}

:::warning
The line immediately above headers must be empty in order this to work. Don't forget to include a space after the <code># </code> either!
:::

### 

To see what other markdown formatting you can apply, go to the **Markdown Quick Reference** by going to the *Help* menu in the RStudio IDE.

![](images/quick-ref.png){.shadow style="width:100%;max-width:500px; margin-bottom: 15px;"}

### 

This will pull up a guide in the *Help* tab of the RStudio file pane.

![](images/quick-ref1.png){.shadow style="width:100%;max-width:500px; margin-bottom: 15px;"}

::: fyi
Markdown is not unique to R Markdown. Many other markdown-aware programs exist, including popular messaging platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and WhatsApp, to name a few.
:::

### 

Use the Markdown Quick Reference to answer the next question.

```{r rmd-quick-ref, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question('What markdown would be necessary to create a link that reads "Search here" and takes you to the page `https://www.google.com`?',
  answer("`(Search here[https://www.google.com])`", correct = FALSE),
  answer("`![Search here](https://www.google.com)`", correct = FALSE), 
  answer("`[Search here](https://www.google.com)`", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Take a closer look.",
  correct = "Yes, this is how you insert links into the knitted reports.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### Inline code

Return to your colleague's knitted penguin report. **How did your colleague get the name of the data set to appear in code font?**

> The `penguins` data set comes from the palmerpenguins package.

```{r rmd-inline, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What markdown formatting is used to style regular text in a code font?", 
  answer("Surround the text in single quotes.", correct = FALSE, message = "They may look like single quotes, but they're actually a different symbol."),
  answer("No markdown is necessary. R Markdown recognizes that this text is a code-related word and formats it automatically.", correct = FALSE), 
  answer('Surround the text in backticks `` ` ` ``.', correct = TRUE, message = "The backtick symbol is found on the left-top of a US or UK layout keyboard, next to the 1 key."),
  try_again = "Take a closer look.",
  correct = "We call this inline code.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### Inline R code

Your colleague's report contains another sentence with inline code. This time it appears to be R code:

> This data set has `nrow(penguins)` rows.

**Insert an `r` immediately after the first backtick (so that it looks like the text below) and re-knit the report.** What do you see?

> This data set has `` `r "\u0060r nrow(penguins)\u0060"` `` rows.

```{r r-inline, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What is the effect of `` `r  ` ``?",
  answer("An `r` appears in the knitted report.", correct = FALSE),
  answer("The inline code is replaced by a code chunk.", correct = FALSE), 
  answer("The R code within the backticks is evaluated.", correct = TRUE),
  correct = "The knitted report shows the result of the evaluated inline R code.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### Takeaway {.takeaway}

You can use markdown to format plain text to insert things like:

* ` # Headers`  
* `[links](https://example.com)`  
*  `` `Inline code` ``, using a leading `` `r `` when you want to evaluate inline R code

...and other elements in your document. 

The Markdown Quick Reference under the Help menu of the RStudio IDE is a good reminder of your options.


## Customize code and results

### 

R Markdown lets you customize your report's code and results, too. Let's continue with your colleague's penguin report to see how.

**Click the button below to add the next section your colleague's penguin report.** It adds a code chunk that subsets a part of the data.


Then...

### 

**Knit your colleague's report again** and inspect the output. There's something strange about this last code chunk. Can you spot what it is?

```{r discover-chunk-options, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What is unusual about this last code chunk?",
  answer("This code chunk produces a silent error.", correct = FALSE),
  answer("At the top of this code chunk, there is some additional text in `{}`.", correct = TRUE), 
  answer("The knitted report shows the output from this code chunk, but it does not display the code that produced this output.", correct = TRUE),
  try_again = "There are two correct answers.",
  correct = "Bingo! You've discovered what we call 'code chunk options'.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### 

Code chunk options tell R Markdown how to handle a chunk when the report is knit.

```{r echo-false, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What does the code chunk option `echo=FALSE` do?",
  answer("Hides the code, but shows its results.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Prevents the code from being run, so no results are displayed.", correct = FALSE, message = "This is actually what the code chunk options `eval=FALSE` does."), 
  answer("Runs the code silently in the background and hides its output.", correct = FALSE, message = "This is actually what the code chunk option `include=FALSE` does."),
  correct = "By default, R Markdown will display all the code in your knitted report. `echo=FALSE` is a common option to override this. Use it whenever the reader of your report will be more interested in the results of your code than the code itself.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### Code chunk options {.takeaway}

There are many different options you can add to a code chunk to customize your report's output. Here are a few of the most useful:

| Chunk option       | Effect in knitted report                                                                                                  |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `echo=FALSE`       | Hides code but displays results.                                                                                          |
| `eval=FALSE`       | Prevents the code from being run, so no results are displayed.                                                            |
| `include=FALSE`    | Runs the code, but hides the code and the results. (Common for code chunks that load packages.)                           |
| `warning=FALSE`    | Suppresses warning messages.                                                                                              |
| `message=FALSE`    | Suppresses other, non-warning messages.                                                                                   |
| `error=TRUE`       | Allows the report to knit, even if the code in the code chunk produces an error.                                          |
| `out.width="100%"` | Rescales the output (plot or image) to take up only the specified width. Can also be specified in pixels, e.g. `"300px"`. |

### 

You can find these and other code chunk options in the [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, under the section "Embed Code with knitr".

[![](images/rmd-cheatsheet.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown.pdf){.shadow style="width:100%; max-width:500px;margin-bottom: 15px;"}


::: fyi
knitr is the name of one of the built-in packages that works with R Markdown under the hood to knit your report. All of the code chunk options that are available fall under this package. You can learn more about the knitr package [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
:::

### 

Use the table introduced above to help your colleague with the next section of the penguin report. **Click the button below to add the new section, and then knit the report again.**


Your colleague has added a plot and is wondering how to show the plot but hide the code and any additional output that this code chunk generates.

### 

What can be added to the last code chunk so that only the plot (i.e. no code nor non-plot output is shown)? **Select all that apply and then fix the report and re-knit to confirm your answer.**

```{r multiple-chunk-options, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("Which of the following code chunk options should be added to acheive the desired output?",
  answer("`echo=FALSE`", correct = TRUE),
  answer("`error=TRUE`", correct = FALSE), 
  answer("`message=FALSE`", correct = TRUE),
  answer("`warning=FALSE`", correct = TRUE),
  try_again = "There are three correct answers.",
  correct = "All three of these should be added to suppress the code, warning, and message output from the plot. The order that they are added does not matter. <br> <br> Make these changes in the penguin report and re-knit.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

::: tip
Multiple options can be applied to the same chunk by separating them with a comma. For example:

```` markdown
`r ''````{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", error=TRUE}

```
````
:::

### `r emo::ji("gear")` The setup chunk

The first chunk in an R Markdown document typically has a label: `setup`.

```{r q1, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question(
  "Does your colleague's penguin document have a setup chunk?",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
  answer("No"), 
  message = "The first chunk in a document is labelled 'setup', which means that the IDE will give it special treatment."
)
```

::: fyi
You can choose to give other chunks in the R Markdown document a label, but each label must be unique. This can help you keep a long document organized.
:::

### 

```` markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
```
````

The setup chunk is special. By giving it the label `setup`, the RStudio IDE will execute its contents in the background before *any* other chunk in the document is run.

This makes the setup chunk the best place to put content that many other chunks depend on.

::: fyi
You'll often see a line like this in a setup chunk: `knitr::opts_chunk$set()`. This is a way to apply global chunks options for the entire R Markdown document. You can learn more about this in [Ch. 11 Chunk Options of the R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/chunk-options.html#chunk-options){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
:::

### 

```{r setup-best-practice, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What kind of content would be well-suited for being placed in the setup chunk? Select all that apply.",
  answer("Reading in the original data set.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Global chunk options.", correct = TRUE), 
  answer("Loading packages with `library()`.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Creating visualizations.", correct = FALSE),
  correct = "It is a best practice to include these in the setup chunk so that it 'sets up' all other chunks in the document to run smoothly.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE, 
  try_again = "There are three correct options."
)
```

### 

Your colleague continues to work on the penguin report and has added some more code chunks.

**Click the button below to add the new section, and then knit report again.**


Then...

### 

You encounter an error when trying to knit the updated report:

```{code}
Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src, markdown_mode) : 
  Duplicate chunk label 'plot1', which has been used for the chunk:
ggplot(
  data = species_bills,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm)
) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Bill length (mm)"
  )
Calls: <Anonymous> ... process_file -> split_file -> lapply -> FUN -> parse_block
Execution halted
```

**Select the answer choice that identifies the problem, and then fix the error in the report.**

```{r dupe-names, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What is causing this knitting error?",
  answer("There is a typo in the code chunk formatting that causes a parsing issue.", correct = FALSE),
  answer("The file containing the raw data set was not read in.", correct = FALSE, message = "In this case the raw data set is already a part of the palmerpenguins package, which has been loaded."), 
  answer("Two code chunks in this document have the same label.", correct = TRUE, message = "All chunk labels in the same R Markdown document must be unique."),
  correct = "This error commonly occurs when users copy and paste from existing code chunks. You can change or remove the label of the second code chunk to fix the problem.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```


## Format with metadata

### 

You've learned about text and code in R Markdown documents. Now, it's time to learn about its metadata. Every R Markdown document can begin with an optional header that contains metadata:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%", out.extra = "class='shadow'"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/meet_rmd.jpg")
```

### 

The metadata is the part of the document that gives R Markdown the instructions for how to build and display the R Markdown report.

```{r fences, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("Take a guess. What denotes the location of the metadata in an R Markdown document?",
  answer("Any content above the setup chunk.", correct = FALSE),
  answer("The first 7 lines of code are reserved for document metadata.", correct = FALSE, message="The R Markdown metadata can be as long or short as it needs to be. There is not line number minimum or maximum."), 
  answer("Anything within the sets of three hypens `---`.", correct = TRUE, message="These are called code fences."),
  correct = "You can customize the way your report looks and feels by adding to or modifying the metadata. There are many options.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### 

The metadata in between the two lines (`---`) are written in a format called **YAML** (rhymes with "camel").

You can edit the YAML metadata just like you edit the body of the R Markdown document. Next, let's change the YAML metadata of your colleague's report.

::: fyi
YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"), and each of its lines consists of *keys* and *values* separated by colons `:`. Key is a fancy word for the variable name that controls a particular document option.
:::

### Customize HTML output

**Edit the YAML metadata so that it looks like mine below.** I have added two YAML options that will customize the HTML output. Be careful -- YAML is fussy about indentation and spacing, so be mindful that your code looks just like mine below.

``` yaml
---
title: "Analysis of Palmer Penguins"
author: Your favorite colleague
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
tutorial:
  id: "rmarkdown_intro/rmarkdown-survey"
---
```

::: tip
The indentation of a line means that it is a sub-option of the unindented option above it.
:::

:::fyi
The last two lines of this YAML header (i.e. "`tutorial:` and `id:`) are specific to Academy. We can ignore these. You won't have this in R Markdown documents that you create from scratch.
:::

### 

Now that you have added new YAML sub-options, **knit your colleague's report once more**.

```{r toc, echo = FALSE}
learnr::question("What affect did `toc: true` and `toc_float: true` have on the penguin report?",
  answer("The allow the report to knit even if there are errors in the code.", correct = FALSE),
  answer("They add a new theme to the document.", correct = FALSE), 
  answer("They create a floating table of contents in the knitting report.", correct = TRUE, message="It remains visible as you scroll through the rest of your report. Cool, huh?"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

### 

Adding a table of contents with those YAML sub-options is a feature of having `output:` set to `html_document`.

`html_document` has many other fun sub-options that can be applied. Reader-friendly examples of many of these can be found in Section 3.1 of [*R Markdown: The Definitive Guide*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

For an exhaustive list of HTML document sub-options, look up `html_document`'s help page: `?rmarkdown::html_document`.

### Takeaway {.takeaway}

Of special note are the following HTML document options, which can all be used indented under `html_document:`

```{r echo=FALSE}
html_opts <- 
  tibble::tribble(
  ~`HTML sub-option`,  ~Description,
  "`theme:`", 
  "Changes font and document colors. Choose from `default`, `cerulean`, `journal`, `flatly`, `darkly`, `readable`, `spacelab`, `united`, `cosmo`, `lumen`, `paper`, `sandstone`, `simplex`, or `yeti`. <br><br> **Example:** `theme: flatly`",
  "`df_print:`",  
  "Controls the table style used to display a printed data frame. Choose from `paged` (interactive and clickable), `kable` (static but richly-formatted), `default` (console output), `tibble` (console output using tibble-style printing). <br><br> **Example:** `df_print: paged`",
  "`code_folding:`",  
  "Allows code chunks to be toggled by the reader in the knitted report. `hide` collapses the toggle; `show` expands it. <br><br> **Example:** `code_folding: hide`",
  "`code_download:`", 
  "Creates a dropdown menu with the option to download the source R Markdown file. <br> <br> **Example:** `code_download: true`")

html_opts %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::fmt_markdown(columns = everything()) %>% 
  gt::tab_options(
    table.font.size = pct(75)
  )
```

```{r df-print-question, echo=FALSE}
learnr::question("Which of the following lines of code would you include to your YAML header to get tables that are interactive?",
  answer("`theme: flatly`", correct = FALSE),
  answer("`df_print: paged`", correct = TRUE),

That brings us to the end of this tutorial! 

You've learned the basics of reporting with R Markdown. You can now:

* Keep your analysis reproducible by knitting early and often
* Format plain text with markdown to produce customized text styling
* Tailor the display of code, results, or both with chunk options
* Customize the appearance and settings of your report with YAML metadata


Happy knitting!
