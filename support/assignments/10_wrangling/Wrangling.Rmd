```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      fig.align = "center",

Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process, involving the **transformation**, **cleaning**, and **preparation** of raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis and visualization. R, a powerful programming language for data analysis and statistics, offers a suite of libraries within the tidyverse ecosystem that streamline and simplify this data manipulation process.


A good reference for data wrangling with R is the [data-wrangling cheat-sheet](https://bit.ly/3vDp74k). 

Question 1: In your own words, try to describe what the pivot functions do, and why they are important. You may use the cheat sheet shown above or the help function in R to explore these functions.
