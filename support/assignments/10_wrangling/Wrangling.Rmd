Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process, involving the **transformation**, **cleaning**, and **preparation** of raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis and visualization. R, a powerful programming language for data analysis and statistics, offers a suite of libraries within the tidyverse ecosystem that streamline and simplify this data manipulation process.

### Exercise 1
**Question:** The code in the figure shows two ways of using the `select` command. The first does not use a pipe, and the second uses a pipe. Run the two commands in the code-chunk below. What is the difference in the output between these two methods? Which method is better, and why?
