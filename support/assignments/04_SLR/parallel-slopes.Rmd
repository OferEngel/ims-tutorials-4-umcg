Between 2007 and 2009, data were collected about penguins in three islands of the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica: the islands of Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). The `penguins` data-set is a collection of data for 342 penguins from 3 different species: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie. If you would like to try and replicate the results, you can find the data set in the [`palmerpenguins` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palmerpenguins/index.html). 

## Palmer Penguins: the data



The data includes the following variables:

- `species`: The penguin's species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie)
- `island`: The island where the penguin lives (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen)
- `bill_length_mm`: The length of the penguin's bill, in millimeters (distance from the penguin's face to the tip of the bill)
- `bill_depth_mm`: The depth of the penguin's bill, in millimeters (height of the bill; distance from the bottom of the bill to the top of the bill)
- `flipper_length_mm`: The length of the penguin's flippers, in millimeters
- `body_mass_g`: The weight of the penguin, in grams
- `sex`: The sex of the penguin
- `year`: The year the observation was made

## Three linear regression models

We want to compare three different models to understand the relationship between penguin weight (grams) and bill depth (mm). Here are the results of our estimation: 


```{r M1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
M1 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_depth_mm,
                         data = penguins)

M2 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_depth_mm + species,
                         data = penguins)
M3 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_depth_mm + species + bill_depth_mm:species, 
         data = penguins)

msummary(list(M1 = M1, M2 = M2, M3 = M3), estimate = "{estimate} ({std.error}){stars}", stars = TRUE, statistic = NULL, 
         gof_omit = "Log|F")

# anova(M1, M2, M3)
# anova(M1, M2, M3, test = "LRT")
# lmtest::lrtest(M1, M2, M3)

# -2*(-2728.667 -	-2498.619)
# pchisq(16.365, df = 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
# qchisq(.05, df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
# qchisq(.05, df = 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
# qchisq(.05, df = 100, lower.tail = FALSE)
```




```{r M1-noshow, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# Linear regression was used to test the association between *bill depth* (*mm*) and *body mass* (gram) using data from n = *342* Penguins. *22.23%* of the variation in *body mass* was explained by *bill depth* ($R^2 = $ *22.23%*). There was a significant *negative* (positive/negative) association between *bill depth* and body-mass (B = *-191.64*; 95% CI = *-229.8*, *-153.5*; p < .001). On average, for every 1-*mm* difference in *bill depth*, penguins differ in mean *body mass* by *-191.64* *gram* 


# > Linear regression was used to test the association between _____ (_____) and _____ (_____) using data from n = _____ Penguins. _____% of the variation in _____ was explained by _____ ($R^2 =$ _____).

## Visualizing the data

Let's visualize the models across the scatter-plot, we will use the code shown below to proeduce the the figure below.
