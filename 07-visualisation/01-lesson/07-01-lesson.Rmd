## Bar Charts


This tutorial will show you how to make and enhance **bar charts** with the ggplot2 package. You will learn how to:

* make and interpret bar charts
* customize bar charts with **aesthetics** and **parameters**
* use **position adjustments**
* use **facets** to create subplots

The tutorial is adapted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the ggplot2 and dplyr packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.

To make a bar chart with ggplot2, add `geom_bar()` to the [ggplot2 template](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/02-Vis-Basics/). For example, the code below plots a bar chart of the `cut` variable in the `diamonds` dataset, which comes with ggplot2. 

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

### The y axis

You should not supply a $y$ aesthetic when you use `geom_bar()`; ggplot2 will count how many times each $x$ value appears in the data, and then display the counts on the $y$ axis. So, for example, the plot above shows that over 20,000 diamonds in the data set had a value of `Ideal`.

You can compute this information manually with the `count()` function from the dplyr package.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut)
```

### geom_col()

Sometimes, you may want to map the heights of the bars not to counts, but to a variable in the data set. To do this, use `geom_col()`, which is short for column. 

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = pressure) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = pressure))
```

### geom_col() data

When you use `geom_col()`, your $x$ and $y$ values should have a one to one relationship, as they do in the `pressure` data set (i.e. each value of `temperature` is paired with a single value of `pressure`).

```{r}
pressure
```

### Exercise 1 - Make a bar chart

Use the code chunk below to plot the distribution of the `color` variable in the `diamonds` data set, which comes in the ggplot2 package.

```{r bcr1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bcr1-solution, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color))
```

### Exercise 2 - Interpretation

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut)) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of diamond cuts")
```

```{r bcr2, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Bar charts",
  question("What is the most common type of cut in the `diamonds` dataset?",
           answer("Fair"),
           answer("Good"),
           answer("Very Good"),
           answer("Premium"),
           answer("Ideal", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),    
  question("How many diamonds in the dataset had a `Good` cut?",
           answer("~2000"),
           answer("~5000", correct = TRUE),
           answer("~7000"),
           answer("~20000"),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

### Exercise 3 - What went wrong?

Diagnose the error below and then fix the code chunk to make a plot.

```{r bcr3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE, error = TRUE}
ggplot(data = pressure) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = pressure))
```

```{r bcr3-solution, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = pressure) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = pressure))
```



```{r bcr3-quiz, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "",
  question("Which arguments are needed in `aes(...)`?",
           answer("`geom_bar` needs `aes(x = ...)`", correct = TRUE),
           answer("`geom_bar` needs `aes(x = ..., y = ...)`"),
           answer("`geom_col` needs `aes(x = ...)`"),
           answer("`geom_col` needs `aes(x = ..., y = ...)`", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


### Exercise 4 - count() and col()

Recreate the bar graph of `color` from exercise one, but this time first use `count()` to manually compute the heights of the bars. Then use `geom_col()` to plot the results as a bar graph. Does your graph look the same as in exercise one?

```{r bcr4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bcr4-solution, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = color, y = n))
```



###  

### Aesthetics for bars

`geom_bar()` and `geom_col()` can use several aesthetics:

* alpha
* color
* fill
* linetype
* size

One of these, color, creates the most surprising results. Predict what the code below will return and then run it.

```{r color, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, color = cut))
```

### fill

The color aesthetic controls the outline of each bar in your bar plot, which may not be what you want. To color the interior of each bar, use the `fill` aesthetic:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, color = cut), size = 1) + 
  ggtitle("color = cut")

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut)) + 
  ggtitle("fill = cut")
```

Use the code chunk below to experiment with fill, along with other `geom_bar()` aesthetics, like alpha, linetype, and size.

```{r color2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, color = cut))
```

### Width

You can control the width of each bar in your bar chart with the `width` parameter. In the chunk below, set `width = 1`, then `width = 0.5`. Can you spot the difference?

```{r width, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut), width = 0.9)
```

Notice that width is a _parameter_, not an aesthetic mapping. Hence, you should set width _outside_ of the `aes()` function.

### Exercise 5 - aesthetics

Create a colored bar chart of the `class` variable from the `mpg` data set, which comes with ggplot2. Map the interior color of each bar to `class`.

```{r bcr5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bcr5-solution, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class, fill = class))
```

### 

### Position adjustments

If you map `fill` to a new variable, `geom_bar()` will display a _stacked_ bar chart:

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

This plot displays 40 different combinations of `cut` and `clarity`, each displayed by its own rectangle. `geom_bar()` lays out the rectangles by stacking rectangles that have the same `cut` value on top of one another. You can change this behavior with a _position adjustment_.

### Position = "dodge"

To place rectangles that have the same `cut` value beside each other, set `position = "dodge"`.

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

This plot shows the same rectangles as the previous chart; however, it lays out rectangles that have the same `cut` value _beside_ each other.

### Position = "stack"

To create the familiar stacked bar chart, set `position = "stack"` (which is the default for `geom_bar()`).

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "stack")
```

### Position = "fill"

To expand each bar to take up the entire $y$ axis, set `position = "fill"`. ggplot2 will stack the rectangles and then scale them within each bar.

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
```

This makes it easy to _compare proportions_. For example, you can scan across the bars to see how the proportion of `IF` diamonds changes from cut to cut. 

### What is a position adjustment?

Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a `position` argument that is preset to a reasonable default. You can use `position` to determine how a geom should adjust objects that would otherwise overlap with each other. 

For example, in our plot, each value of `cut` is associated with eight rectangles: one each for `I1`, `SI2`, `SI1`, `VS2`, `VS1`, `VVS2`, `VVS1`, and `IF`. Each of these eight rectangles deserves to go in the same place: directly above the value of `cut` that it is associated with, with the bottom of the rectangle placed at count = 0. But if we plotted the plot like that, the rectangles would overlap each other.

Here's what that would look like if you could peek around the side of the graph.


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/TCBTfJx.png")
```

### Position = "identity"

..and here's what that would look like if you could see the graph from the front. You can make this plot by setting `position = "identity"`. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "identity")
```

Position adjustments tell ggplot2 how to re-distribute objects when they overlap. `position = "identity"` is the "adjustment" that let's objects overlap each other. It is a bad choice for bar graphs because the result looks like a stacked bar chart, even though it is not. 

### Exercise 6 - Positions

Use the code chunk to recreate the plot you see below. Remember: `color` is the name of a variable in `diamonds` (not to be confused with an aesthetic).

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = clarity), position = "fill", width = 1)
```

```{r bcr6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bcr6-solution, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = clarity), position = "fill", width = 1)
```

### Exercise 7 - Positions

Use the code chunk to recreate the plot you see below. Remember: `color` is the name of a variable in `diamonds` (not to be confused with an aesthetic).

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut), position = "dodge")
```

```{r bcr7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bcr7-solution, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut), position = "dodge")
```

### Exercise 8 - position = "identity"

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color), position = "identity")
```

```{r q8, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Why is position = "identity" a bad idea?',
     question('Suppose the graph above uses position = "stack". About how many diamonds have an ideal cut and a G color?',
              answer("5000", message = 'This would be true if the graph uses `position = "identity"`. Can you tell why?'),
              answer("3000"),
              answer("1800", correct = TRUE, message = "In a stacked bar chart, you can calculate the number of observations in each bar by subtracting the y value at the bottom of the bar from the y value at the top."),
              answer("The graph doesn't contain enough information to make an estimate."),
              allow_retry = TRUE),
     question('Suppose the graph above uses position = "identity". About how many diamonds have an ideal cut and a G color?',
              answer("5000", correct = TRUE, message = "Here the green bar extends all the way from 5000 to 0; most of the bar is behind the blue, purple, and magenta bars. In practice, you would never construct a bar chart like this."),
              answer("3000"),
              answer("1800", message = 'This would be true if the graph uses `position = "fill"`. Can you tell why?'),
              answer("The graph doesn't contain enough information to make an estimate."),
              allow_retry = TRUE)
)
```

### 

### Facetting

You can more easily compare subgroups of data if you place each subgroup in its own subplot, a process known as **facetting.**

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ cut)
```

### facet_grid()

ggplot2 provides two functions for facetting. `facet_grid()` divides the plot into a grid of subplots based on the values of one or two facetting variables. To use it, add `facet_grid()` to the end of your plot call. 

The code chunks below, show three ways to facet with `facet_grid()`. Spot the differences between the chunks, then run the code to learn what the differences do.

```{r facet1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color)) +
  facet_grid(clarity ~ cut)
```

```{r facet2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cut)
```

```{r facet3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color)) +
  facet_grid(clarity ~ .)
```

### facet_grid() recap

As you saw in the code examples, you use `facet_grid()` by passing it a formula, the names of two variables connected by a `~`. 

`facet_grid()` will split the plot into facets vertically by the values of the first variable: each facet will contain the observations that have a common value of the variable. `facet_grid()` will split the plot horizontally by values of the second variable. The result is a grid of facets, where each specific subplot shows a specific combination of values.

If you do not wish to split on the vertical or horizontal dimension, pass `facet_grid()` a `.` instead of a variable name as a place holder.

### `facet_wrap()`

`facet_wrap()` provides a more relaxed way to facet a plot on a _single_ variable. It will split the plot into subplots and then reorganize the subplots into multiple rows so that each plot has a more or less square aspect ratio. In short, `facet_wrap()` _wraps_ the single row of subplots that you would get with `facet_grid()` into multiple rows. 

To use `facet_wrap()` pass it a single variable name with a `~` before it, e.g. `facet_wrap( ~ color)`.

Add `facet_wrap()` to the code below to create the graph that appeared at the start of this section. Facet on `cut`.

```{r facet4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut))
```

```{r facet4solution, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ cut)
```

### scales

By default, each facet in your plot will share the same $x$ and $y$ ranges. You can change this by adding a `scales` argument to `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`.

* `scales = "free"` will let the $x$ and $y$ range of each facet vary
* `scales = "free_x"` will let the $x$ range of each facet vary, but not the $y$ range
* `scales = "free_y"` will let the $y$ range of each facet vary, but not the $x$ range. This is a convenient way to compare the shapes of different distributions:

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
      facet_wrap( ~ cut, scales = "free_y")
    ```


### Recap

In this section of the tutorial, you learned how to make bar charts; but much of what you learned applies to other types of charts as well. Here's what you should know:

* Bar charts are the basis for histograms, which means that you can interpret histograms in a similar way.
* Bars are not the only geom in ggplot2 that use the fill aesthetic. You can use both fill and color aesthetics with any geom that has an "interior" region.
* You can use the same position adjustments with any ggplot2 geom: `"identity"`, `"stack"`, `"dodge"`, `"fill"`, `"nudge"`, and `"jitter"` (we'll learn about `"nudge"` and `"jitter"` later). Each geom comes with its own sensible default.
* You can facet any ggplot2 plot by adding `facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()` to the plot call.

Bar charts are an excellent way to display the distribution of a categorical variable. In the next tutorial, we'll meet a set of geoms that display the distribution of a continuous variable.



## Exploratory Data Analysis


This tutorial will show you how to explore your data in a systematic way, a task that statisticians call **exploratory data analysis**, or **EDA** for short. In the tutorial you will:

* Learn a strategy for exploring data
* Practice finding patterns in data
* Get tips about how to use different types of plots to explore data

The tutorial is excerpted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

### What is EDA?

EDA is an iterative cycle that helps you understand what your data says. When you do EDA, you:

1. Generate questions about your data

1. Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and/or modeling your data

1. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions

EDA is an important part of any data analysis. You can use EDA to make discoveries about the world; or you can use EDA to ensure the quality of your data, asking questions about whether the data meets your standards or not.

### The EDA mindset

EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. More than anything, EDA is a state of mind. During the initial phases of EDA, you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some of these ideas will pan out, and some will be dead ends. As your exploration continues, you will home in on lines of inquiry that reveal insights worth writing up and communicating to others.

### Questions

Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make.

> "Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often
> vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made
> precise." --- John Tukey

### Quantity vs Quality

EDA is, fundamentally, a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking _quality_ questions is to generate a large _quantity_ of questions. It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights are contained in your dataset. On the other hand, each new question that you ask will highlight a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery. You can quickly drill down into the most interesting parts of your data---and develop a set of thought-provoking questions---if you follow up each question with a new question based on what you find.

> "There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical
> routines." --- Sir David Cox

### Two useful questions

There is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these questions as:

1. What type of **variation** occurs **within** my variables?

1. What type of **covariation** occurs **between** my variables?

The rest of this tutorial will look at these two questions. To make the discussion easier, let's define some terms...

### Definitions

*   A __variable__ is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure. 

*   A __value__ is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a
    variable may change from measurement to measurement.
  
*   An __observation__ or __case__ is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object). An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. I'll sometimes refer to an observation as a case or data point.

*   __Tabular data__ is a table of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is __tidy__ if each value is placed in its own cell, each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row. 
    
    So far, all of the data that you've seen has been tidy. In real-life, most data isn't tidy, so we'll come back to these ideas again in [Data Wrangling]().
    
### Review 1 - Discovery or Confirmation?

You can think of science as a process with two steps: _discovery_ and _confirmation_. Scientists first observe the world to discover a hypothesis to test. Then, they devise a test to confirm the hypotheses against new data. If a hypothesis survives many tests, scientists begin to trust that it is a reliable explanation of the data.

The separation between discovery and confirmation is especially important for data scientists. It is easy for patterns to appear in data by coincidence. As a result, data scientists first look for patterns, and then try to confirm that the patterns exist in the real world. Sometimes this confirmation requires computing the probability that the pattern is due to random chance, a task that often involves collecting new data.

```{r eda-q1, echo = FALSE}
question("Is EDA a tool for discovery or confirmation?",
         answer("Discovery", correct = TRUE, message = "EDA is a tool for discovery; in fact, EDA is one of the most fruitful tools for discovery in science. We'll focus on discovery throughout this primer, but remember that you should test any pattern that you discover before you rely on it."),
         answer("Confirmation", message = "EDA reveals patterns, but it does not confirm that those patterns exist beyond your data set."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)

### Review 2 - Quality or Quantity?

```{r eda-q2, echo = FALSE}
question("When you begin to explore data, is it better to formulate one or two high-quality questions to ask, or many, many questions to explore?",
         answer("One or two high-quality questions", message = "It is hard to spot useful questions ahead of time because you don't know which discoveries are waiting in your data."),
         answer("Many, many questions", correct = TRUE, message = "Each question you ask creates a new opportunity to discover something surprising. You can lead yourself to high-value questions by iterating on questions that reveal unexpected results."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Review 3 - Definitions

`iris` is a famous toy data set that comes with R. The data set describes 150 iris flowers. Each row in `iris` displays a flower's sepal and petal dimensions. You can use these measurements to deduce the flower's species, which is also displayed in `iris`.

```{r}
iris
```

```{r eda-q3, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Variables, values, and observations",
     question("Which of these is a variable in the `iris` dataset?",
              answer("setosa"),
              answer("Sepal.Length", correct = TRUE),
              answer("flowers"),
              answer("5.1"),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              random_answer_order = TRUE),
     question("Which of these is a value in the `iris` dataset?",
              answer("3.5", correct = TRUE),
              answer("Petal.Length", message = "This is the name of one of the variables in the data set."),
              answer("flowers"),
              answer("Species", message = "This is the name of one of the variables in the data set."),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              random_answer_order = TRUE),
     question("Which of these is an observation in the `iris` dataset?",
              answer("The collection of measurements, `5.1`, `3.5`, `1.4`, `0.2`, and `setosa`, which describe the first flower in the data set.", correct = TRUE, message = "These measurements were all collected under similar circumstances: on the same flower, presumably at the same time. If a relationship exists between the variables that these values describe, we would expect the relationship to also exist between these values."),
              answer("The collection of names, `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, `Petal.Width`, and `Species`.", message = "These names describe the variables in the data set."),
              answer("The collection of measurements, `5.1`, `4.9`, `4.7`, and so on, which are all of the values in the Sepal.Length column.", message = "These are the values of the Sepal.Length variable."),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```



### What is variation?

**Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. You can see variation easily in real life; if you measure any continuous variable twice---and precisely enough---you will get two different results. This is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light. Each of your measurements will include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. Categorical variables can also vary if you measure across different objects (e.g. the eye colors of different people), or different times (e.g. the energy levels of an electron at different moments). 

Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal useful information. The best way to understand that pattern is to visualise the distribution of the variable's values. How you visualise the distribution of a variable will depend on whether the variable is **categorical** or **continuous**. 

### Categorical variables

A variable is **categorical** if it can take only one of a small set of values. In R, categorical variables are usually saved as factors or character vectors. You can visualize the distribution of a categorical variable with a bar chart, like the one below. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = class)) + 
  ggtitle("Classes of cars in mpg")
```

Don't worry if you cannot make or interpret a bar chart. We'll survey several types of charts in this tutorial, as we create a strategy for EDA. You'll learn how to build each type of chart in the tutorials that follow.

### Continuous variables

A variable is **continuous** if it can take any of an infinite set of smooth, ordered values. Here, smooth means that if you order the values on a line, an infinite number of values would exist between any two points on the line. For example, an infinite number of values exists between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, and so on. 

Numbers and date-times are two examples of continuous variables. You can visualize the distribution of a continuous variable with a histogram, like the one below:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = faithful) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = eruptions), binwidth = 0.25) + 
  ggtitle("Lengths of 272 eruptions of Old Faithful")
```

### Frequencies

In both bar charts and histograms, tall bars show the common values of a variable, i.e. the values that appear frequently. Shorter bars show less-common values, i.e. values that appear infrequently. Places that do not have bars reveal values that were not seen in your data. To turn this information into useful questions, look for anything unexpected:

* Which values are the most common? Why?

* Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?

* Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?

* Are there any **outliers**, which are points that don't fit the pattern or fall far away from the rest of the data? Are they the result of data entry errors or something else?

Many of the questions above will prompt you to explore a relationship *between* variables, to see if the values of one variable can explain the values of another variable. We'll get to that shortly.

### Review 4 - Frequencies

The bar chart below visualises the distribution of the `class` variable in the `mpg` data set, which comes in the ggplot2 package. The height of the bars reveal how many cars in the data set come from each class. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = class)) + 
  ggtitle("Classes of cars in mpg")
```

```{r eda-fq1, echo = FALSE}

quiz(caption = "The distribution of class in `mpg`",
  question("What is the most common type of car in the `mpg` data set?",
           answer("2seater"),
           answer("compact"),
           answer("midsize"),
           answer("minivan"),
           answer("pickup"),
           answer("subcompact"),
           answer("suv", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What is the least common type of car in the `mpg` data set?",
           answer("2seater", correct = TRUE),
           answer("compact"),
           answer("midsize"),
           answer("minivan"),
           answer("pickup"),
           answer("subcompact"),
           answer("suv"),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ), 
  question("Does the distribution of cars in the `mpg` dataset seem to reflect the distribution of cars that you see on the road? Would your answer shape how you use this data?",
           answer("I have my answers", correct = TRUE) 
  )
)
```

### Clusters

For continuous variables, clusters of similar values suggest that subgroups exist in your data. To understand the subgroups, ask:

* How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?

* How are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?

* How can you explain or describe the clusters?

* Why might the appearance of clusters be misleading?


### Review 5 - Clusters

The histogram below shows the distribution of the `eruptions` variable in the `faithful` data set, which comes with R. `eruptions` shows the lengths (in minutes) of 272 eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park.

To interpret the histogram, look first at the x axis, which displays the lengths of eruptions recorded in the data. The range of the x axis shows that the shortest eruptions lasted for about one minute and the longest for about five minutes. 

To see how many eruptions lasted for a specific length of time, find the length of time on the x axis and then look at the height of the bar above the length of time. For example, according to the histogram, 30 eruptions lasted for about two minutes, but only three lasted for about three minutes (the height of the bar above two is 30, the height of the bar above three is three).

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = faithful) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = eruptions), binwidth = 0.25) + 
  ggtitle("Lengths of 272 eruptions of Old Faithful")
```

```{r eda-cq1, echo = FALSE}
question("Do the eruption lengths cluster into groups? How many?",
           answer("No. There are no clusters."),
           answer("Yes. Two clusters.", correct = TRUE, message = "Eruption lengths appear to be clustered into two groups: there are short eruptions (of around 2 minutes) and long eruptions (4-5 minutes), but few eruptions in between."),
           answer("Yes. Three clusters."),
           answer("Yes. Four clusters."),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```


### What is covariation?

If variation describes the behavior _within_ a variable, covariation describes the behavior _between_ variables. **Covariation** is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. The best way to spot covariation is to visualise the relationship between two or more variables. How you do that should again depend on whether your variables are categorical or continuous.

### Two categorical variables

You can plot the relationship between two categorical variables with a heatmap or with geom_count:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n)) +
    ggtitle("Color grade vs. cut quality for 53940 diamonds")

ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_count(aes(color, cut)) +
    ggtitle("Color grade vs. cut quality for 53940 diamonds")
```

Again, don't be concerned if you do not know how to make these graphs. For now, let's focus on the strategy of how to use visualizations in EDA. You'll learn how to make different types of plots in the tutorials that follow. 

### One continuous and one categorical variable

You can plot the relationship between one continuous and one categorical variable with a boxplot:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(reorder(class, hwy, median), hwy)) +
    ggtitle("Pickup trucks and SUVs display the lowest fuel efficiency") +
    labs(x = "class")
```

### Two continuous variables

You can plot the relationship between two continuous variables with a scatterplot:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = faithful) +
  geom_point(aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) + 
  ggtitle("Length of eruption vs wait time before eruption")
```

### Patterns

Patterns in your data provide clues about relationships. If a systematic relationship exists between two variables it will appear as a pattern in the data. If you spot a pattern, ask yourself:

+ Could this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?

+ How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?

+ How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?

+ What other variables might affect the relationship?

+ Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?

Remember that clusters and outliers are also a type of pattern. Two dimensional plots can reveal clusters and outliers that would not be visible in a one dimensional plot. If you spot either, ask yourself what they imply.

### Review 6 - Patterns

The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the length of an eruption of Old Faithful and the wait time before the eruption (i.e. the amount of time that passed between it and the previous eruption).

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = faithful) +
  geom_point(aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) + 
  ggtitle("Length of eruption vs wait time before eruption")
```

```{r pq1, echo = FALSE}
question("Does the scatterplot above reveal a pattern that helps to explain the variation in lengths of Old Faithful eruptions?",
         answer("No. There is no pattern."),
         answer("Yes. Long eruptions are associated with a _short_ wait before the eruption"),
         answer("Yes. Long eruptions are associated with a _long_ wait before the eruption", correct = TRUE, message = "The data seems to suggest that a long build up before an eruption is associated with a long eruption. The plot also shows the two clusters that we saw before: there are long eruptions with a long build up and short eruptions with a short build up."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Uncertainty 

Patterns provide a useful tool for data scientists because they reveal covariation. If you think of variation as a phenomenon that creates uncertainty, covariation is a phenomenon that reduces it. When two variables covary, you can use the values of one variable to make better predictions about the values of the second. If the covariation is due to a causal relationship (a special case), you can use the value of one variable to control the value of the second.



### A note on observations

Observations are one of the trickiest ideas in data science, but they are easy to understand in the light of covariation. As scientists, we want to discover covariation, or more generally, the relationships between variables. Think of an observation as _a tool for discovering relationships between variables_. Here's how it works:

An observation is a set of values, but not all sets of values are observations. To be an observation, a set of values will need a specific property: _If a relationship exists between the variables that the values describe, then the relationship will also exist between the values themselves_. If this is true, then each observation will give us a glimpse of the relationship. If we visualize many observations, we can see the shape of the relationship---literally.

Not every combination of values will have this property. For example, if you pair the wait time before a geyser eruption that occurs today with the length of a geyser eruption that occurs tomorrow, the combination will tell you little about the relationship between the wait time before an eruption and the length of the eruption.

### Which combination?

The correct combination of values to use will depend on the relationship that you are trying to discover. 



### Recap

You've learned a lot in this tutorial. Here's what you should keep with you:

* EDA is an iterative cycle built around asking and refining questions.
* These two questions are always useful:
    1. What type of variation occurs _within_ my variables?
    1. What type of covariation occurs _between_ my variables?
* Remember the definitions of _variables_, _values_, _observations_, _variation_, _covariation_, _categorical_, and _continuous_. You'll see them again. Frequently.

Throughout the tutorial, you also encountered several recommendations for plots that visualize variation and covariation for categorical and continuous variables. Plots are a bit like questions in EDA: you should make many quickly and try anything that strikes your fancy. You can refine your plots later to share with others. A lot of refinement will occur naturally as you iterate during EDA. 

The suggestions below can serve as starting point for visualizing data. In the tutorials that follow, you will learn how to make each type of plot, as well as how to use best practices and advanced skills when visualizing data.

## Histograms

**Histograms** are the most popular way to visualize continuous distributions. Here we will look at them and their derivatives. You will learn how to:

* Make and interpret histograms
* Adjust the **binwidth** of a histogram to reveal new information
* Use geoms that are similar to histograms, such as __dotplots__, __frequency polygons__, and __densities__

The tutorial is adapted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the ggplot2 and dplyr packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.

### How to make a histogram

To make a histogram with ggplot2, add `geom_histogram()` to the [ggplot2 template](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/02-Vis-Basics/). For example, the code below plots a histogram of the `carat` variable in the `diamonds` dataset, which comes with ggplot2. 

```{r hist1, exercise = TRUE, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat))
```

### The y variable

As with `geom_bar()`, you do not need to give `geom_histogram()` a $y$ variable. `geom_histogram()` will construct its own $y$ variable by counting the number of observations that fall into each bin on the $x$ axis. `geom_histogram()` will then map the counts to the $y$ axis. 

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat))
```

As a result, you can glance at a bar to determine how many observations fall within a bin. Bins with tall bars highlight common values of the $x$ variable.

### Exercise 1 - Interpretation

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat))
```

```{r r1, echo = FALSE}
question("According to the chart, which is the most common carat size in the data?",
         answer("Approximately 0.3 or 0.4 carats", correct = TRUE, message = "More than 15,000 diamonds in the data have a value in the bin near 0.3 and 0.4. That's more than any other bin. How do we know? because the bar above 0.3 to 0.4 goes to 15,000, higher than any other bar in the plot."),
         answer("Approximately 1 carat"),
         answer("Approximately 1.5 carat"),
         answer("Approximately 2 carats"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### binwidth

By default, ggplot2 will choose a binwidth for your histogram that results in about 30 bins. You can set the binwidth manually with the `binwidth` argument, which is interpreted in the units of the x axis:

```{r hist2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 1)
```

### bins

Alternatively, you can set the binwidth with the `bins` argument which takes the total number of bins to use:

```{r hist3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), bins = 10)
```

It can be hard to determine what the actual binwidths are when you use `bins`, since they may not be round numbers.

### boundary

You can move the bins left and right along the $x$ axis with the `boundary` argument. `boundary` takes an $x$ value to use as the boundary between two bins (ggplot2 will align the rest of the bins accordingly): 

```{r hist4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), bins = 10, boundary = 0)
```

### Exercise 2 - binwidth

When you use `geom_histogram()`, you should always experiment with different binwidths because different size bins reveal different types of information.

To see an example of this, make a histogram of the `carat` variable in the `diamonds` dataset. Use a bin size of 0.5 carats. What does the overall shape of the distribution look like?

```{r hist-r2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r hist-r2-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! The most common diamond size is about 0.5 carats. Larger sizes become progressively less frequent as carat size increases. This accords with general knowledge about diamonds, so you may be prompted to stop exploring the distribution of carat size. But should you?"
```

```{r hist-r2-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```

### Exercise 3 - another binwidth

Recreate your histogram of `carat` but this time use a binwidth of 0.1. Does your plot reveal new information? Look closely. Is there more than one peak? Where do the peaks occur?

```{r hist-r3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r hist-r3-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! The new binwidth reveals a new phenomena: carat sizes like 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2 are much more common than carat sizes that do not fall near a common fraction. Why might this be?"
```

```{r hist-r3-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.1)
```

### Exercise 4 - another binwidth

Recreate your histogram of `carat` a final time, but this time use a binwidth of 0.01 and set the first boundary to zero. Try to find one new pattern in the results.

```{r hist-r4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r hist-r4-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! The new binwidth reveals another phenomena: each peak is very right skewed. In other words, diamonds that are 1.01 carats are much more common than diamonds that are .99 carats. Why would that be?"
```

```{r hist-r4-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.01, boundary = 0)
```

### aesthetics

Visually, histograms are very similar to bar charts. As a result, they use the same aesthetics: _alpha_, _color_, _fill_, _linetype_, and _size_.

They also behave in the same odd way when you use the color aesthetic. Do you remember what happens?

```{r hist-q1, echo = FALSE}
question("Which aesthetic would you use to color the interior fill of each bar in a histogram?",
         answer("color", message = 'For histograms, color controls color of the outline of each bar.'),
         answer("fill", correct = TRUE, message = 'For geoms with "substance", like bars, fill controls the color of the interior of the geom. Color controls the outline.'),
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 5 - Putting it all together

Recreate the histogram below. 

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```

```{r hist-r5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r hist-r5-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! Did you ensure that each binwidth is 1000 and that the first boundary is zero?"
```

```{r hist-r5-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```


### Similar geoms: A problem

By adding a fill color to our histogram below, we've divided the data into five "sub-distributions": the distribution of price for Fair cut diamonds, for Good cut diamonds, for Very Good cut diamonds, for Premium cut diamonds, and for Ideal cut diamonds.

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```

But this display has some shortcomings:

* it is difficult to see the "shapes" of the individual distributions
* it is difficult to compare the individual distributions, because they do not share a common baseline value for $y$.

### A solution

We can improve the plot by using a different geom to display the distributions of price values. ggplot2 includes three geoms that display the same information as a histogram, but in different ways:

1. `geom_freqpoly()`
1. `geom_density()`
1. `geom_dotplot()`

### geom_freqpoly()

`geom_freqpoly()` plots a _frequency polygon_, which uses a line to display the same information as a histogram. You can think of a frequency polygon as a line that would connect the top of each bar that appears in a histogram, like this:

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.25, boundary = 0, fill = "grey50") +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.25, boundary = 0, size = 0.7)
```

Note that the bars are not part of the frequency polygon; they are just there for reference. `geom_freqpoly()` recognizes the same parameters as `geom_histogram()`, such as `bins`, `binwidth`, and `boundary`.

### Exercise 6 - Frequency polygons

Create the frequency polygon depicted above. It has a binwidth of 0.25 and starts at the boundary zero.

```{r hist-r6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r hist-r6-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! By using a line instead of bars, frequency polygons can sometimes do things that histograms cannot."
```

```{r hist-r6-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.25, boundary = 0)
```

### Exercise 7 - Multiple frequency polygons

Use a frequency polygon to recreate our chart of price and cut. Since lines do not have "substance" like bars, you will want to use the color aesthetic instead of the fill aesthetic.

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```

```{r hist-r7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r hist-r7-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! Since lines do not occlude each other, `geom_freqpoly()` plots each sub-group against the same baseline: y = 0 (i.e. it unstacks the sub-groups). This makes it easier to compare the distributions. You can now see that for almost every price value, there are more Ideal cut diamonds than there are other types of diamonds."
```

```{r hist-r7-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = price, color = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```

### geom_density()

Our frequency polygon highlights a second shortcoming with our graph: it is difficult to compare the shapes of the distributions because some sub-groups contain more diamonds than others. This compresses smaller subgroups into the bottom of the graph.

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = price, color = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```

You can avoid this with `geom_density()`.

### Density curves

`geom_density()` plots a kernel density estimate (i.e. a density curve) for each distribution. This is a smoothed representation of the data, analogous to a smoothed histogram. 

Density curves do not plot count on the $y$ axis but _density_, which is analagous to the count divided by the total number of observations. Densities makes it easy to compare the distributions of sub-groups. When you plot multiple sub-groups, each density curve will contain the same area under its curve.

```{r out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(data = c(rnorm(1000), rnorm(500, mean = 3), rnorm(100, mean = 6)),
                   group = c(rep("A", 1000), rep("B", 500), rep("C", 100)))
ggplot(data = data) +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(x = data, color = group)) +
  ggtitle("Data with counts")

ggplot(data = data) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = data, color = group)) + 
  ggtitle("Same data with densities")
```

### Exercise 8 - Density curves

Re-draw our plot with density curves. How do you interpret the results?

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```

```{r hist-r8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r hist-r8-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! You can now compare the most common prices for each sub-group. For example, the plot shows that the most common price for most diamonds is near $1000. However, the most common price for Fair cut diamonds is significantly higher, about $2500. We will come back to this oddity in a later tutorial."
```

```{r hist-r8-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = price, color = cut))
```

### Density parameters

Density plots do not take `bin`, `binwidth`, and `boundary` parameters. Instead they recognize kernel and smoothing parameters that are used in the density fitting algorithm, which is fairly sophisticated. 

In practice, you can obtain useful results quickly with the default parameters of `geom_density()`. If you'd like to learn more about density estimates and their tuning parameters, begin with the help page at `?geom_density()`.

### geom_dotplot()

ggplot2 provides a final geom for displaying one dimensional distributions: `geom_dotplot()`. `geom_dotplot()` represents each observation with a dot and then stacks dots within bins to create the semblance of a histogram.

Dotplots can provide an intuitive display of the data, but they have several shortcomings. Dotplots are not ideal for large data sets like `diamonds`, and provide meaningless $y$ axis labels. I also find that the tuning parameters of `geom_dotplot()` make dotplots too slow to work with for EDA.

```{r dotplot, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_dotplot(mapping = aes(x = displ), dotsize = 0.5, stackdir = "up", stackratio = 1.1)
```

### Exercise 9 - Facets

Instead of changing geoms, you can make the sub-groups in our original plot easier to compare by facetting the data. Extend the code below to facet by cut.

```{r hist-r9, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0)
```

```{r hist-r9-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! Facets make it easier to compare sub-groups, but at the expense of separating the data. You may decide that frequency polygons and densities allow more direct comparisons."
```

```{r hist-r9-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut), binwidth = 1000, boundary = 0) +
  facet_wrap( ~cut)
```

### Recap

In this tutorial, you learned how to visualize distributions with histograms, frequency polygons, and densities. But what should you look for in these visualizations?

* **Look for places with lots of data.** Tall bars reveal the most common values in your data; you can expect these values to be the "typical values" for your variable.

* **Look for places with little data.** Short bars reveal uncommon values. These values appear rarely and you might be able to figure out why.

* **Look for outliers.** Bars that appear away from the bulk of the data are outliers, special cases that may reveal unexpected insights. 
    
    Sometimes outliers cannot be seen in a plot, but can be inferred from the range of the $x$ axis. For example, many of the plots in this tutorial seemed to extend well past the end of the data. Why? Because the range was stretched to include outliers. When your data set is large, like `diamonds`, the bar that describes an outlier may be invisible (i.e. less than one pixel high).
    
* **Look for clusters.**

* **Look for shape.** The shape of a histogram can often indicate whether or not a variable behaves according to a known probability distribution.

The most important thing to remember about histograms, frequency polygons, and dotplots is to explore different binwidths. The binwidth of a histogram determines what information the histogram displays. You cannot predict ahead of time which binwidth will reveal unexpected information.




## Boxplots


**Boxplots** display the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. **Count** plots display the relationship between two categorical variables. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use both. You will learn how to:

* Make and interpret boxplots
* Rotate boxplots by flipping the coordinate system of your plot
* Use *violin* plots and *dotplots*, two geoms that are similar to boxplots
* Make and interpret count plots

The tutorial is adapted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the ggplot2 and dplyr packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.

### Exercise 1 - Boxplots

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/B5NdFwO.png")
```


```{r bp-r1, echo = FALSE}
question("Which of the sub-plots accurately describes the data above with a boxplot?",
         answer("A", message = "Good try, but this is tricky. The middle of this box is near the middle of the range of the data, but it is not the median. The median depends on how many observations are on each side of the value."  ),
         answer("B", message = "This box extends the entire range of the data. This could be a useful plot, ggplot2 calls it a crossbar, but it is not a boxplot"),
         answer("C", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### How to make a boxplot

To make a boxplot with ggplot2, add `geom_boxplot()` to the [ggplot2 template](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/02-Vis-Basics/). For example, the code below uses boxplots to display the relationship between the `class` and `hwy` variables in the `mpg` dataset, which comes with ggplot2. 

```{r boxplot, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

### Categorical and continuous

`geom_boxplot()` expects the $y$ axis to be continuous, but accepts categorical variables on the $x$ axis. For example, here `class` is categorical. `geom_boxplot()` will automatically plot a separate boxplot for each value of $x$. This makes it easy to compare the distributions of points with different values of $x$.

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

### Exercise 2 - Interpretation

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r bp-r2, echo = FALSE}
question("Which class of car has the lowest median highway fuel efficiency (`hwy` value)?",
         answer("2seater"),
         answer("compact"),
         answer("midsize"),
         answer("minivan"),
         answer("pickup", correct = TRUE),
         answer("subcompact"),
         answer("suv", message = "Close. But look closer."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Exercise 3 - Make a Boxplot

Recreate the boxplot below with the diamonds data set.

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price))
```

```{r bp-r3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bp-r3-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price))
```

```{r bp-r3-check, eval=FALSE}
"Do you notice how many outliers appear in the plot? The boxplot algorithm can identify many outliers if your data is big, perhaps too many. Let's look at ways to suppress the appearance of outliers in your plot."
```

### Outliers

You can change how outliers look in your boxplot with the parameters `outlier.color`, `outlier.fill`, `outlier.shape`, `outlier.size`, `outlier.stroke`, and `outlier.alpha` (`outlier.shape` takes a number from 1 to 25). 

Unfortunately, you can't tell `geom_boxplot()` to ignore outliers completely, but you can make outliers disappear by setting `outlier.alpha = 0`. Try it in the plot below.

```{r bp-outliers, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price), outlier.shape  = 24, 
               outlier.fill = "white", outlier.stroke = 0.25)
```

```{r bp-outliers-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price), outlier.alpha = 0)
```

<!--

### notch and varwidth

You can further customize your boxplots with the parameters `notch` and `varwidth`. `notch` adds a notch near the median of each box. `varwidth` maps the width of the boxplots on the $x$ axis to the number of points described by the boxplot. This makes it easy to see which distributions have the most points.

Add `varwidth` to the plot below.

```{r varwidth, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price), notch = TRUE)
```

```{r varwidth-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price), notch = TRUE, varwidth = TRUE)
```

```{r varwidth-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! You can also customize boxplots with traditional ggplot2 aesthetics. Let's take a look."
```

-->

### Aesthetics

Boxplots recognize the following aesthetics: _alpha_, _color_, _fill_, _group_, _linetype_, _shape_, _size_, and _weight_.

Of these _group_ can be the most useful. Consider the plot below. It uses a continuous variable on the $x$ axis. As a result, `geom_boxplot()` is not sure how to split the data into categories: it lumps all of the data into a single boxplot. The result reveals little about the relationship between carat and price.

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

In the next sections, we'll use _group_ to make a more informative plot.

### How to "cut" a continuous variable

ggplot2 provides three helper functions that you can use to split a continuous variable into categories. Each takes a continuous vector and returns a categorical vector that assigns each value to a group. For example, `cut_interval()` bins a vector into `n` equal length bins.

```{r}
continuous_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
continuous_vector
```

```{r}
cut_interval(continuous_vector, n = 3)
```

### The cut functions

The three cut functions are

* `cut_interval()` which makes `n` groups with equal range
* `cut_number()` which makes `n` groups with (approximately) equal numbers of observations
* `cut_width()` which makes groups with width `width`

Use one of three functions below to bin `continuous_vector` into groups of `width = 2`.

```{r cut-setup}
continuous_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
continuous_vector
```

```{r cut, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
continuous_vector
```

```{r cut-solution}
cut_width(continuous_vector, width = 2)
```

```{r cut-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! Now let's apply the cut functions to our graph."
```

### Exercise 4 - Apply a cut function

When you set the $group$ aesthetic of a boxplot, `geom_boxplot()` will draw a separate boxplot for each collection of observations that have the same value of whichever vector you map to $group$. 

This means we can split our `carat` plot by mapping $group$ to the output of a cut function, as in the code below. Study the code, then modify it to create a separate boxplot for each 0.25 wide interval of `carat`.

```{r bp-r4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, group = cut_interval(carat, n = 2)))
```

```{r bp-r4-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, group = cut_width(carat, width = 0.25)))
```

```{r r4-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! You can now see a relationship between price and carat. You could also make a scatterplot of these variables, but in this case, it would be a black mass of 54,000 data points."
```

### coord_flip()

`geom_boxplot()` always expects the categorical variable to appear on the $x$ axis, which create horizontal boxplots. But what if you'd like to make horizontal boxplots, like in the plot below?

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  coord_flip()
```

You can do this by adding `+ coord_flip()` to your plot call. 

### Exercise 5 - Horizontal boxplots

Extend the code below to orient the boxplots horizontally.

```{r bp-r5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r bp-r5-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r bp-r5-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! `coord_flip()` is an example of a new coordinate system. You'll learn much more about ggplot2 coordinate systems in a later tutorial."
```




### Similar Geoms: geom_dotplot()

Boxplots provide a quick way to represent a distribution, but they leave behind a lot of information. ggplot2 supplements boxplots with two geoms that show more information.

The first is `geom_dotplot()`. If you set the `binaxis` parameter of `geom_dotplot()` to `"y"`, `geom_dotplot()` behaves like `geom_boxplot()`, display a separate distribution for each group of data.

Here each group functions like a vertical histogram. Add the parameter `stackdir = "center"` then re-run the code. Can you interpret the results?

```{r bp-r6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_dotplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy), binaxis = "y", 
               dotsize = 0.5, binwidth = 1)
```

```{r bp-r6-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_dotplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy), binaxis = "y", 
               dotsize = 0.5, binwidth = 1, stackdir = "center")
```

```{r bp-r6-check, eval=FALSE}
'Good job! When you set `stackdir = "center"`, `geom_dotplot()` arranges each row of dots symmetrically around the $x$ value. This layout will help you understand the next geom.

As in the histogram tutorial, it takes a lot of tweaking to make a dotplot look right. As a result, I tend to only use them when I want to make a point.'
```

### geom_violin()

`geom_violin()` provides a second alternative to `geom_boxplot()`. A violin plot uses densities to draw a smoothed version of the centered dotplot you just made.

You can think of a violin plot as an outline drawn around the edges of a centered dotplot. Each "violin" spans the range of the data. The violin is thick where there are many values, and thin where there are few.

Convert the plot below from a boxplot to a violin plot. Note that violin plots do not use the parameters you saw for dotplots.

```{r bp-r7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r bp-r7-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r bp-r7-check, eval=FALSE}
'Good job! Another way to interpret a violin plot is to mentally "push" the width of each violin all to one side (so the other side is a straight line). The result would be a density (e.g. `geom_density()`) turned on its side for each distribution).'
```

### Exercise 7 - Violin plots

You can further enhance violin plots by adding the parameter `draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`. This will cause ggplot2 to draw horizontal lines across the violins at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. These are the same three horizontal lines that are displayed in a boxplot (the 25th and 75th percentiles are the bounds of the box, the 50th percentile is the median).

Add these lines to the violin plot below.

```{r bp-r8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r bp-r8-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy), draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
```

```{r bp-r8-check, eval=FALSE}
'Good job! Can you predict how you would use `draw_quantiles` to draw a horizontal line at a different percentile, like the 60th percentile?.'
```



### Counts: geom_count()

Boxplots provide an efficient way to explore the interaction of a continuous variable and a categorical variable. But what if you have two categorical variables?

You can see how observations are distributed across two categorical variables with `geom_count()`. `geom_count()` draws a point at each combination of values from the two variables. The size of the point is mapped to the number of observations with this combination of values. Rare combinations will have small points, frequent combinations will have large points.

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = color, y = clarity))
```

### Exercise 8 - Count plots

Use `geom_count()` to plot the interaction of the `cut` and `clarity` variables in the `diamonds` data set.

```{r bp-r9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bp-r9-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = clarity))
```

### count

You can use the `count()` function in the **dplyr** package to compute the count values displayed by `geom_count()`. To use `count()`, pass it a data frame and then the names of zero or more variables in the data frame. `count()` will return a new table that lists how many observations occur with each possible combination of the listed variables.

So for example, the code below returns the counts that you visualized in Exercise 8.

```{r}
 diamonds %>% 
   count(cut, clarity)
```

### Heat maps

Heat maps provide a second way to visualize the relationship between two categorical variables. They work like count plots, but use a fill color instead of a point size, to display the number of observations in each combination.

### How to make a heat map

ggplot2 does not provide a geom function for heat maps, but you can construct a heat map by plotting the results of `count()` with `geom_tile()`. 

To do this, set the x and y aesthetics of `geom_tile()` to the variables that you pass to `count()`. Then map the fill aesthetic to the `n` variable computed by `count()`. The plot below displays the same counts as the plot in Exercise 8.

```{r}
 diamonds %>% 
   count(cut, clarity) %>% 
   ggplot() +
     geom_tile(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = clarity, fill = n))
```

### Exercise 9 - Make a heat map

Practice the method above by re-creating the heat map below.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
 diamonds %>% 
   count(color, cut) %>% 
   ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
     geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

```{r bp-r10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bp-r10-solution}
 diamonds %>% 
   count(color, cut) %>% 
   ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
     geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

```{r bp-r10-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job!"
```


### Recap

Boxplots, dotplots and violin plots provide an easy way to look for relationships between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. Violin plots convey a lot of information quickly, but boxplots have a head start in popularity --- they were easy to use when statisticians had to draw graphs by hand.

In any of these graphs, look for distributions, ranges, medians, skewness or anything else that catches your eye to change in an unusual way from distribution to distribution. Often, you can make patterns even more revealing with the `fct_reorder()` function from the forcats package (we'll wait to learn about forcats until after you study factors).

Count plots and heat maps help you see how observations are distributed across the interactions of two categorical variables.





## Scatterplots


A **scatterplot** displays the relationship between two continuous variables. Scatterplots are one of the most common types of graphs---in fact, you've met scatterplots already in [Visualization Basics](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/02-Vis-Basics/). 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

* Make new types of scatterplots with `geom_text()` and `geom_jitter()`
* Add multiple **layers** of geoms to a plot
* Enhance scatterplots with `geom_smooth()`, `geom_rug()`, and `geom_repel()`
* Change the **coordinate system** of a plot

The tutorial is adapted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the ggplot2, ggrepel, and dplyr packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.

In [Visualization Basics](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/02-Vis-Basics/), you learned how to make a scatterplot with `geom_point()`.

The code below summarises the mpg data set and begins to plot the results. Finish the plot with `geom_point()`. Put `mean_cty` on the $x$ axis and `mean_hwy` on the $y$ axis.

```{r spr1, exercise = TRUE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot()
```

```{r spr1-solution}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy))
```

```{r spr1-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! It can be tricky to remember when to use %>% and when to use +. Use %>% to add one complete step to a pipe of code. Use + to add one more line to a ggplot2 call."
```


### geom_text()

`geom_text()` and `geom_label()` create scatterplots that use words instead of points to display data. Each requires the extra aesthetic `label`, which you should map to a variable that contains text to display for each observation.

Convert the plot below from `geom_point()` to `geom_text()` and map the label aesthetic to the class variable. When you are finished convert the code to `geom_label()` and rerun the plot. Can you spot the difference?

```{r spr2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy))
```

```{r spr2-solution}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_text(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy, label = class))

mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_label(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy, label = class))
```

```{r spr2-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! geom_text() replaces each point with a piece of text supplied by the label aesthetic. geom_label replaces each point with a textbox. Notice that some pieces of text overlap each other, and others run off the page. We'll soon look at a way to fix this."
```


### geom_smooth()

In [Visualization Basics](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/02-Vis-Basics/), you met `geom_smooth()`, which provides a summarised version of a scatterplot.

`geom_smooth()` uses a model to fit a smoothed line to the data and then visualizes the results. By default, `geom_smooth()` fits a loess smooth to data sets with less than 1,000 observations, and a generalized additive model to data sets with more than 1,000 observations. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy)) +
    ggtitle("geom_point)") +
    ylim(16, 30)

mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy), se = FALSE) +
    ggtitle("geom_smooth()") +
    ylim(16, 30)
```

### method

You can use the `method` parameter of `geom_smooth()` to fit and display other types of model lines. To do this, pass `method` the name of an R modeling function for `geom_smooth()` to use, such as `lm` (for linear models) or `glm` (for generalized linear models).

In the code below, use `geom_smooth()` to draw the linear model line that fits the data.

```{r spr3, exercise = TRUE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() 
```

```{r spr3-solution}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy), method = lm)
```

```{r spr3-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! Now let's look at a way to make geom_smooth() much more useful."
```


### Add a layer

`geom_smooth()` becomes much more useful when you combine it with `geom_point()` to create a scatterplot that contains both:

* raw data
* a trend line

In ggplot2, you can add multiple geoms to a plot by adding multiple geom functions to the plot call. For example, the code below creates a plot that contains both points and a smooth line. Imagine what the results will look like in your head, and then run the code to see if you are right.

```{r spr4, exercise = TRUE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy), method = lm) 
```

```{r spr4-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! You can add as many geom functions as you like to a plot; but, in practice, a plot will become hard to interpret if it contains more than two or three geoms."
```

### geom_label_repel()

Do you remember how the labels that we made early overlapped each other and ran off our graph? The `geom_label_repel()` geom from the ggrepel package mitigates these problems by using an algorithm to arrange labels within a plot. It works best in conjunction with a layer of points that displays the true location of each observation.

Use `geom_label_repel()` to add a new layer to our plot below. `geom_label_repel()` requires the same aesthetics as `geom_label()`: x, y, and label (here set to class).

```{r spr5, exercise = TRUE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy), method = lm)
```

```{r spr5-solution}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy), method = lm) +
    geom_label_repel(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy, label = class))
```

```{r spr5-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! The ggrepel package also provides geom_text_repel(), which is an analog for geom_text()."
```

### Code duplication

If you study the solution for the previous exercise, you'll notice a fair amount of duplication. We set the same aesthetic mappings in three different places.

```{r eval = FALSE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy), method = lm) +
    geom_label_repel(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy, label = class))
```

You should try to avoid duplication whenever you can in code because duplicated code invites typos, is hard to update, and takes longer than needed to write. Thankfully, ggplot2 provides a way to avoid duplication across multiple layers.

### ggplot() mappings

You can set aesthetic mappings in two places within any ggplot2 call. You can set the mappings inside of a geom function, as we've been doing. Or you can set the mappings inside of the `ggplot()` function like below:

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Global vs. Local mappings

ggplot2 will treat any mappings set in the `ggplot()` function as _global_ mappings. Each layer in the plot will inherit and use these mappings. 

ggplot2 will treat any mappings set in a geom function as _local_ mappings. Only the local layer will use these mappings. The mappings will override the global mappings if the two conflict, or add to them if they do not.

This system creates an efficient way to write plot calls:

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(color = class), se = FALSE)
```

### Exercise 2

Reduce duplication in the code below by moving as many local mappings into the global mappings as possible. Rerun the new code to ensure that it creates the same plot.

```{r spr6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy), method = lm) +
    geom_label_repel(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy, label = class))
```

```{r spr6-solution}
mpg %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cty = mean(cty), mean_hwy = mean(hwy)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mean_cty, y = mean_hwy)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm) +
    geom_label_repel(mapping = aes(label = class))
```

```{r spr6-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! Remember that not every mapping should be a global mapping. Here, only geom_label_repel uses the label aesthetic. Hence, it should remain a local aesthetic to avoid unintended side effects, warnings, or errors."
```


### Exercise 3 - Global vs. Local

Recreate the plot below in the most efficient way possible.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

```{r spr7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r spr7-hint}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = ___)) +
  geom_smooth()
```


### Global vs. Local data

The `data` argument also follows a global vs. local system. If you set the `data` argument of a geom function, the geom will use the data you supply instead of the data contained in `ggplot()`. This is a convenient way to highlight groups of points.

Use `data` arguments to recreate the plot below. I've started the code for you.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mpg2 <- filter(mpg, class == "2seater")

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = mpg2, color = "red", size = 2)
```

```{r spr8, exercise = TRUE, }
mpg2 <- filter(mpg, class == "2seater")
```

```{r spr8-solution}
mpg2 <- filter(mpg, class == "2seater")

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = mpg2, color = "red", size = 2)
```

```{r spr8-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good Job!"
```

### Exercise 4 - Global vs. Local data

Use `data` arguments to recreate the plot below.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mpg3 <- filter(mpg, hwy > 40)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(data = mpg3, mapping = aes(label = class))
```

```{r spr9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r spr9-solution}
mpg3 <- filter(mpg, hwy > 40)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(data = mpg3, mapping = aes(label = class))
```

```{r spr9-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good Job!"
```

### last_plot()

When exploring data, you'll often make a plot and then think of a way to improve it. Instead of starting from scratch or copying and pasting your code, you can use ggplot2's `last_plot()` function. `last_plot()` returns the most recent plot call, which makes it easy to build up a plot one layer at a time.

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

last_plot() +
  geom_smooth()

last_plot() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "purple")
```

### Saving plots

If you'd like to work with a plot later, you can save it to an R object. Later you can display the plot or add to it, as if you were using `last_plot()`. 

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy))
```

Notice that ggplot2 will not display a plot when you save it. It waits until you call the saved object.

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
p
```


### geom_rug()

`geom_rug()` adds another type of summary to a plot. It uses displays the one dimensional marginal distributions of each variable in the scatterplot. These appear as collections of tickmarks along the $x$ and $y$ axes.

In the chunk below, use the `faithful` dataset to create a scatterplot that has the `waiting` variable on the $x$ axis and the `eruptions` variable on the $y$ axis. Use `geom_rug()` to add a rug plot to the scatterplot. Like `geom_point()`, `geom_rug()` requires x and y aesthetic mappings.

```{r spr10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r spr10-solution}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_rug()
```

```{r spr10-check, eval=FALSE}
'Good job! Pass geom_rug() the parameter sides = "l" to limit the rug plot to just the left-hand axis (y) or sides = "b" to limit the rug plot to just the bottom axis (x).'
```


### geom_jitter()

`geom_jitter()` plots a scatterplot and then adds a small amount of random noise to each point in the plot. It is a shortcut for adding a "jitter" position adjustment to a points plot (i.e, `geom_point(position = "jitter")`).

Why would you use `geom_jitter()`? Jittering provides a simple way to inspect patterns that occur in heavily gridded or overlapping data. To see what I mean, replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()` in the plot below.

```{r spr11, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r spr11-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r spr11-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! You can also jitter in only a single direction. To turn off jittering in the x direction set width = 0 in geom_jitter(). To turn off jittering in the y direction, set height = 0." 
```


### jitter and boxplots

`geom_jitter()` provides a convenient way to overlay raw data on boxplots, which display summary information.

Use the chunk below to create a boxplot of the previous graph. Arrange for the outliers to have an alpha of 0, which will make them completely transparent. Then add a layer of points that are jittered in $y$ direction, but not the $x$ direction.

```{r spr12, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r spr12-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0)
```

```{r spr12-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! If you like, you can make the boxplots more visible by setting the alpha parameter of geom_jitter() to a low number, e.g. geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy), width = 0, alpha = 0.5)"
```



### coord_flip()

One way to customize a scatterplot is to plot it in a new coordinate system. ggplot2 provides several helper functions that change the coordinate system of a plot. You've already seen one of these in action in the [boxplots tutorial](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/04-boxplots): `coord_flip()` flips the $x$ and $y$ axes of a plot.

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0) +
  coord_flip()
```

### The coord functions

Altogether, ggplot2 comes with seven coord functions:

* `coord_cartesian()` - (the default) Cartesian coordinates
* `coord_fixed()` - Cartesian coordinates that maintain a fixed aspect ratio as the plot window is resized
* `coord_flip()` - Cartesian coordinates with x and y axes flipped
* `coord_map()` and `coord_quickmap()` - cartographic projections for plotting maps
* `coord_polar()` - polar coordinates
* `coord_trans()` - transformed Cartesian coordinates

By default, ggplot2 will draw a plot in Cartesian coordinates unless you add one of the functions above to the plot code.

### coord_polar()

You use each coord function like you use `coord_flip()`, by adding it to a ggplot2 call.

So for example, you could add `coord_polar()` to a plot to make a graph that uses polar coordinates.

```{r out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut), width = 1) 

last_plot() +
  coord_polar()
```

### Coordinate systems and scatterplots

How can a coordinate system improve a scatterplot? 

Consider, the scatterplot below. It shows a strong relationship between the carat size of a diamond and its price. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) 
```

However, the relationship does not appear linear. It appears to have the form $y = x^{n}$, a common relationship found in nature. You can estimate the $n$ by replotting the data in a _log-log plot_.

### log-log plots

Log-log plots graph the log of $x$ vs. the log of $y$, which has a valuable visual effect. If you log both sides of a relationship like

$$y = x^{n}$$

You get a linear relationship with slope $n$:

$$log(y) = log(x^{n})$$
$$log(y) = n \cdot log(x)$$

In other words, log-log plots unbend power relationships into straight lines. Moreover, they display $n$ as the slope of the straight line, which is reasonably easy to estimate.

Try this by using the diamonds dataset to plot `log(carat)` against `log(price)`.

```{r spr13, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r spr13-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log(carat), y = log(price))) 
```

```{r spr13-check, eval=FALSE}
"Good job! Now let's look at how you can do the same transformation, and others as well with a coord function."
```

### coord_trans()

`coord_trans()` provides a second way to do the same transformation, or similar transformations.

To use `coord_trans()` give it an $x$ and/or a $y$ argument. Set each to the name of an R function surrounded by quotation marks. `coord_trans()` will use the function to transform the specified axis before plotting the raw data. 

```{r spr14, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  coord_trans(x = "log", y = "log")
```


### Recap

Scatterplots are one of the most useful types of plots for data science. You will have many chances to use `geom_point()`, `geom_smooth()`, and `geom_label_repel()` in your day to day work.

However, this tutor introduced important two concepts that apply to more than just scatterplots:

* You can add **multiple layers** to any plot that you make with ggplot2
* You can add a different **coordinate system** to any plot that you make with ggplot2
