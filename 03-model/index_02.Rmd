Ultimately, data analysis is about understanding relationships among variables. Exploring data with multiple variables requires new, more complex tools, but enables a richer set of comparisons. In this tutorial, you will learn how to describe relationships between two numerical quantities. You will characterize these relationships graphically, in the form of summary statistics, and through simple linear regression models.

In this tutorial you'll also take your skills with simple linear regression to the next level. By learning multiple and logistic regression techniques you will gain the skills to model and predict both numeric and categorical outcomes using multiple input variables. You'll also learn how to fit, visualize, and interpret these models. Then you'll apply your skills to learn about Italian restaurants in New York City!

## Learning objectives

* Visualize, measure, and characterize bivariate relationships
* Fit, interpret, and assess simple linear regression models
* Measure and interpret model fit
* Identify and attend to the disparate impact that unusual data observations may have on a regression model
* Compute with `lm` objects in R
* Compute and visualize model predictions
* Visualize, fit, interpret, and assess a variety of multiple regression models, including those with interaction terms
* Visualize, fit, interpret, and assess logistic regression models
* Understand the relationship between R modeling syntax and geometric and mathematical specifications for models

## Lessons


### 4.1 ~~[Sampling variability](https://oferengel-posit.shinyapps.io/04-01-lesson/)  **deadline 17-Oct-23**~~

The fundamental principle that there is variability across different samples will be investigated in this lesson. You will be able to characterize the variability across samples as compared to the underlying population. Remember, the goal of the research is to understand the population, while the information you have comes only from a single sample of data.


### ~~[4.2 Simple linear regression](https://oferengel-posit.shinyapps.io/03-03-lesson/) **deadline 24-Oct-23**~~

* Visualize a simple linear model as "best fit" line
* Conceptualize simple [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)
* Fit and describe simple linear regression models
* Internalize [regression to the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean)

### ~~[4.3 Interpreting regression models](https://oferengel-posit.shinyapps.io/03-04-lesson/) **deadline 24-Oct-23**~~

* Interpret the meaning of coefficients in a regression model
* Understand the impact of units and scales
* Work with `lm` objects in R
* Make predictions from regression models
* Overlay a regression model on a scatterplot

### ~~[4.4 Model fit](https://oferengel-posit.shinyapps.io/03-05-lesson/) **deadline 24-Oct-23**~~

* Assess the quality of fit of a regression model
* Interpret [$R^2$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination)
* Measure [leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(statistics)) and influence
* Identify and attend to outliers

### ~~[4.5 - Parallel slopes](https://oferengel-posit.shinyapps.io/03-06-lesson/) **deadline 24-Oct-23**~~

* Visualize, fit, and interpret a parallel slopes model, which has one numeric and one categorical explanatory variable
* Describe a model in three different ways: mathematically, graphically, and through R syntax



###  [4.6 Evaluating and extending parallel slopes model](https://oferengel-posit.shinyapps.io/03-07-lesson/) **deadline 31-Oct-23**

* Assess and interpret model fit
* Compute residuals and predictions
* Fit and interpret interaction models
* Recognize [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)**deadline 31-Oct-23**

### [4.7 Multiple regression](https://oferengel-posit.shinyapps.io/03-08-lesson/)**deadline 31-Oct-23**

* Visualize, fit, and interpret a multiple regression model with two numeric explanatory variables
* Visualize, fit, and interpret a parallel planes model with two numeric explanatory variables and a categorical variable
* Fit and interpret multiple regression models in higher dimensions
* Understand and identify [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity)
