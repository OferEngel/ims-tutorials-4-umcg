Practical knowledge of statistics is a fundamental skill for medical research. The recent growth of Big Data Applications and Data Science only enhances the need for practical working knowledge of statistical analysis, helping you understand your own data as well as the analyses performed by others.

This course is designed to be a gentle introduction to the practice of solving problems in bio-statistics and epidemiology in a data driven manner. The course assumes no prior programming/coding experience. It is designed to provide the tools you need to progress according to your interest and in your time as much as possible. Succeeding in this course will be able to:

-   Use a modern suite of software packages for statistics and data science
-   Identify descriptive statistics for data exploration such as measures of spread and central tendency, measures of association and causation
-   Recognize various graphical representations of data, their advantages, and disadvantages
-   Fit a range of models such as linear least square regression (LLSR) and generalized linear models (GLM).
-   Perform statistical inference using statistical inference, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing procedures.

## Presenting your work

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG31rF2fmEQ) presents some guidelines for presenting your lab code and report. Before you present, please make sure you publish your final report on Rpubs. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ36zamYVLg) are some instructions. Remember you may need to register and/or sign into RPubs first. Here's [another link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7DADwfZMDU) with explanations.
