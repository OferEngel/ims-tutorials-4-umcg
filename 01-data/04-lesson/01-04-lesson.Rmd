## Case study

In this last lesson of the tutorial, we will work on a case study, based on data from a study titled "[Beauty in the Classroom](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775704001165)".

 
College courses often conclude by giving students the opportunity to anonymously evaluate both the course and the instructor. The question that motivated this study was whether a teacher's attractiveness affects their anonymous evaluations.

![](images/evals-data.png){width="70%"}

The data in this case study consists of course evaluations as well as scoring of professors' physical attractiveness. The data was collected as part of a study conducted at University of Texas, Austin.


## Exercise: Beauty in the classroom

### Inspect the data

The purpose of this lesson is to give you an opportunity to apply and practice what you've learned on a real world dataset. For this reason, we'll provide a little less guidance than usual.

Inspect the `evals` data frame using techniques you learned in previous lessons. Use an approach that shows you how many observations and variables are included in the dataset. This data is in the **openintro** package and we will use functions from the **tidyverse** for our analysis. You can read more about the data [here](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/evals.html). 

Note that for the purposes of this analysis we have added an additional variable to the dataset, `cls_type`. This variable classifies classes as small, midsize, or large, depending on the number of students in the class. This was done using the following.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
evals |>
  mutate(cls_type = case_when(
    cls_students <= 18 ~ "small",
    cls_students <= 59 ~ "midsize",
    cls_students >= 60 ~ "large"
    )
  )
```


```{r inspect-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
# Inspect evals
```

```{r inspect-data-solution}
# Inspect evals
glimpse(evals)

# Alternative solution
dim(evals)
```

### Identify type of study

```{r quiz-identify-type-study}
quiz(
  question("What type of study is this?", correct = "How observant! It was an observational study.", allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer("Observational study", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Experiment", message = "Try again!")
    ), 
  question("Each row (observation) in this data set represents _____.", correct = "Good!", allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer("a class", correct = TRUE),
    answer("a student", message = "Try again!"),
    answer("a school", message = "Nope!")
    ), caption = "")
```

## Variables in the data

Let's take a closer look at each of the variables in the course evaluations dataset.

Remember that using the `glimpse()` function we can obtain a list of the variables and take a peek at the first few observations from each.

```{r glimpse-evals, exercise=TRUE}
# Glimpse the data
glimpse(___)
```



```{r glimpse-evals-solution}
# Glimpse the data
glimpse(evals)
```
Besides two id columns, we have the following variables: 

-   `score` is the average evaluation score of the professor for a given course. Scores range between 1 and 5 with 1 being a poor evaluation and 5 being an excellent evaluation.
-   The variables `rank`, `ethnicity`, `gender` and `age` are about the professor. Their rank (teaching faculty, tenure track, or tenured), Whether they are from a minority, whether they are male or female, and their age. 
-   `cls_perc_eval` is the percent of students who completed the evaluations, number of students who completed the evaluations, 
-   `cls_students` is the total number of students in the class, 
-   `bty_avg` is the average attractiveness score of the professors in the sample. This was determined by six students who were provided photos of the professors to rate, 3 female students and 3 male students. In their scoring 1 indicates a low attractiveness score and 10 a high attractiveness score.

```{r quiz-which-cat}
question("Which of the variables are categorical?", allow_retry = TRUE,
    answer("score"), 
    answer("rank", correct = TRUE),
    answer("ethnicity", correct = TRUE), 
    answer("gender", correct = TRUE), 
    answer("age"), 
    answer("cls_perc_eval"), 
    answer("cls_students"), 
    answer("bty_avg")
    )
```


### Recode a variable

The `cls_students` variable in `evals` tells you the number of students in the class. Suppose instead of the exact number of students, you're interested in whether the class is 

*   `"small"` (18 students or fewer), 
*   `"midsize"` (19 - 59 students), or 
*   `"large"` (60 students or more).


Recode the `cls_students` variable into a new variable, `cls_type`, using `case_when()`. This command is part of the tidyverse package. If you are unsure how to use the clause, try searching it on the web in combination with `tidyverse`.

This new variable should have three levels  as  described above. Save the resulting data frame (with the new variable) as `evals`. 

- *What type of variable is `cls_type`?*

```{r type-of-variable, exercise=TRUE}
# Recode cls_students as cls_type
evals <- evals |>
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      ___ ~ "small",
      ___ ~ "midsize",
      ___ ~ "large"
    )
  )

evals
```



```{r type-of-variable-hint-1}
# Recode cls_students as cls_type
evals <- evals |>
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      cls_students <= ___ ~ "small",
      ___ <= ___ ~ "midsize",
      ___ >= ___ ~ "large"
    )
  )

evals
```


```{r type-of-variable-hint-2}
# Recode cls_students as cls_type
evals <- evals |>
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      cls_students <= 18 ~ "small",
      ___ <= ___ ~ "midsize",
      ___ >= ___ ~ "large"
    )
  )

evals
```

```{r type-of-variable-hint-3}
# Recode cls_students as cls_type
evals <- evals |>
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      cls_students <= 18 ~ "small",
      cls_students <= 59 ~ "midsize",
      ___ >= ___ ~ "large"
    )
  )

evals
```

```{r type-of-variable-solution}
# Recode cls_students as cls_type
evals <- evals |>
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      cls_students <= 18 ~ "small",
      cls_students <= 59 ~ "midsize",
      cls_students >= 60 ~ "large"
    )
  )

evals
```

```{r prepare_classtype, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Recode cls_students as cls_type
evals <- evals |>
  mutate(
    cls_type = case_when(
      cls_students <= 18 ~ "small",
      cls_students <= 59 ~ "midsize",
      cls_students >= 60 ~ "large"
    )
  )

evals
```

To see the `cls_type` variable, you will need to scroll to the right most column. The new variable is added at the very end of the dataset.


### Create a scatterplot

The `bty_avg` variable shows the average beauty rating of the professor by the six students who were asked to rate the attractiveness of these faculty. The `score` variable shows the average professor evaluation score, with 1 being *very unsatisfactory* and 5 being *excellent*.

-   Use `ggplot()` to create a scatterplot displaying the relationship between these two variables. 
-   To create a scatter plot, add a `+ geom_point()` layer   
- *How would you describe the relationship apparent in this visualization?*

```{r create-scatterplot, exercise=TRUE,  exercise.setup="prepare_classtype"}
# Scatterplot of score vs. bty_avg
___(evals, ___) +
  ___
```

```{r create-scatterplot-solution}
# Scatterplot of score vs. bty_avg
ggplot(evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Create a scatterplot, with an added aesthetic

Suppose you are interested in evaluating how the relationship between a professor's attractiveness and their evaluation score varies across different class types (small, midsize, and large).

- Recreate your visualization from the previous exercise, but this time color the points by class type (you will need to map the `color` of the point to the variable `cls_type`)

- *How would you describe the relationship apparent in this visualization?*

```{r scatterplot-added-layer, exercise=TRUE,  exercise.setup="prepare_classtype"}
# Scatterplot of score vs. bty_avg colored by cls_type
___(evals, ___) +
  ___
```

```{r scatterplot-added-layer-solution}
# Scatterplot of score vs. bty_avg colored by cls_type
ggplot(evals, aes(x = bty_avg, y = score, color = cls_type)) +
  geom_point()
```
