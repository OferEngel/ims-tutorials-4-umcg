Practical knowledge of statistics is a fundamental skill for medical research. The recent growth of Big Data Applications and Data Science only enhances the need for practical working knowledge of statistical analysis, helping you  understand your own data as well as the analyses performed by others.



This course is designed to be a gentle introduction to the practice of solving problems in bio-statistics and epidemiology in a data driven manner. The course assumes no prior programming/coding experience. It is designed to provide the tools you need to progress according to your interest and in your time as much as possible. 
Succeeding in this course will be able to:

-   Use a modern suite of software packages for statistics and data science
-   Identify descriptive statistics for data exploration such as measures of spread and central tendency, measures of association and causation
-   Recognize various graphical representations of data, their advantages, and disadvantages
-   Fit a range of models such as the chi-square, the t-test, variance analysis, linear least square regression (LLSR) and generalized linear models (GLM). 
-   Perform statistical inference using statistical inference, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing procedures



### Preparation readings and videos

You will find all the readings and lectures in your the [Perusall course home](https://app.perusall.com/courses/cpe-medical-statistics).
